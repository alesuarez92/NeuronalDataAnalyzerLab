# Changelog

All notable changes to NeuroAnalyzerLab_MATLAB are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-07

First public release. The repo bundles a complete UI, the LDF and electrophysiology
processing pipelines, ROI / coregistered image analysis, and the signal-feature
extractor. The version string is displayed in every app footer next to the
copyright and is the single source of truth in `core/UITheme.version`.

### Added

- **Main launcher** with three sections — Filtering & Signal Processing,
  Imaging & ROI, Signal Characterization — and a project-directory bar that
  remembers Import / Export folders across sessions.
- **LDF pipeline**: Extract LDF Data (load, crop, save), Process LDF Data
  (filter, downsample, segment by stimulus onsets), Average LDF Viewer
  (grand average across trials with optional baseline correction).
- **Electrophysiology pipeline**: Extract Ephys Data (TDT tank load,
  multi-channel select), Process LFP Data (ERP averaging, CSD analysis),
  Process MUA Data (configurable spike sorting — detection method,
  threshold, refractory, alignment, polarity, feature extraction,
  clustering, drift correction).
- **ROI / Coregistered Image Analysis** (`apps/ROIAnalysisApp.m` plus
  `core/imaging/`): ROI- and line-based brightness, movement, ΔF/F
  for calcium imaging, blood-flow speed, kymograph, vessel diameter.
  Includes preprocessing toggles (B&W 256, Gaussian smoothing,
  per-frame normalization).
- **Signal Characterization**: peak latency, onset delay (50%), FWHM,
  AUC positive / negative, rise time, decay time, peak amplitude,
  stimulation–response integration. Multi-select the features to
  compute; results land in a uitable; export to CSV or MAT.
- **Help window** (`apps/HelpApp.m`) with workflow and principle figures
  for each pipeline.
- **Shared UI theme** (`core/UITheme.m`) — color palette, header height,
  axes-panel padding, version constant. Used by every app to keep the
  look consistent.
- **Imaging utilities** under `core/imaging/`: `deltaFOverF`, `kymograph`,
  `propagationSpeedFromKymograph`, `roiFlowSpeed`, `roiIntensityOverTime`,
  `roiMovement`, `vesselDiameterFromLine`, plus `imageStackNormalize`,
  `imageStackSmooth`, `imageToGrayscale256`.

### Notes

This is an early release — the UI works end-to-end on the lab's data
formats, but the public surface is not yet stable. Expect tightening
of error handling, more validation around input formats, and additional
analyses in 0.2.x.
